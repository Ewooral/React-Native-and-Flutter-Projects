# Core Components and Native Components

    React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

# Views and mobile development

    In Android and iOS development, a view is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds of views can contain other views. It’s views all the way down!

# Core Components

React Native has many Core Components for everything from form controls to activity indicators. You can find them all documented in the API section. You will mostly work with the following Core Components:

    React-Native-UI-Component    |	Android View     | 	 iOS View    |    Web Analog               |	Description

    <View>                          <ViewGroup>	         <UIView>      A non-scrollling <div>                 
   
    <Text>                                                                  <p>
    
    <Image>                                                                <img>
    
    <ScrollView>                                                           <div>
    
    <TextInput>                                                            <input type="text">
